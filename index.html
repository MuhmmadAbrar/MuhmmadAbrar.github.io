							<h2>College Life..</h2>
							<p>I joined VIT Chennai in 2021 to pursue my Undergrad degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE).
								But, I was always interested in computers and I wanted to pursue Computer Science.
								Things went in my way, when I got a chance to switch to Computer Science in the 2nd year through Programme Migration.
								I am currently in my 2nd year and I am enjoying my college life.
								I am a member of the Microsoft Innovations Club and I am also a part of the Linux Users Group (LUGVITC) Club.

							<h2>Developing my interest in Electronics</h2>

								coursera during my free time. I also did some projects in Arduino and participated in some competitions.
